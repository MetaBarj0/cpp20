# Programming with C++ 20

Written by Andreas Fertig.

Gonna study Concepts, Coroutines, Ranges and more.

## Practical aspects

The book examples run with clang 13, clang 14 should be ok.
The code is experienced through test cases using catch2

## Chapter 1: Concepts

They are predicates for strongly typed generic code.

They facilitate te writing of template meta programming code.
They provide better and more explicit error messages for generic template meta programming code misusage.

### Playing with examples

Got to src/chapter_1_concepts/tests.cpp to get a grasp on the matter.
